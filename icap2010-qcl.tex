Dark resonances due to coherent population trapping (CPT) offer naturally narrow line widths and are well suited for frequency standards. The width of these resonances can be reduced by using buffer gas. In continuous wave (CW) systems line width below 30Hz were previously observed in rubidium\footnote{M.~Erhard and H.~Helm, PRA {\bf 63}, 043813 (2001)}. For further improvement we use a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser for optical pumping. This has the advantage of all interacting modes being in phase with each other, while in CW case the phase coherence of the pump lasers limit performance. Our system is unique in that the repetition rate and the offset frequency can be tuned independently \footnote{W-Y.~Cheng, T-H.~Wu, S-W.~Huang, S-Y.~Lin and C-M.~Wu, Applied Physics B {\bf 92}, 13 (2008)}. 

The repetition rate of the mode-locked laser is set to be near an integer multiple of the ground state hyperfine splitting of caesium (the ``clock frequency''). By scanning the repetition rate we probe the dark resonance. Compared to previous similar experiments\footnote{S.~Brattke, U.~Kallmann, and W.-D.~Hartmann,  Eur. Phys. J. D {\bf 3}, 159 (1998)} we use a different element and higher buffer gas temperature. In a cell buffered with 8700~kPa neon at 100$^\circ$C we recorded 6.1(8)~Hz line width (Figure 1). The expected large frequency shift of the resonance due to the buffer gas (several kHz) is absent, the observed shift is much smaller than the line width.

An optical clock based on this CPT signal using mode locked lasers will have the advantage of narrower resonance, much reduced systematic frequency shifting effects and due to its higher peak power the ability to use thicker optical medium, achieving better signal-to-noise ratio.

We present our systematic studies of the this CPT signal and its theoretical analysis.
