\begin{block}{Coherent population trapping clock}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Coherent population trapping (CPT) is able to produce robust, narrow linewidth transitions
  \item In our scheme we further reduce the linewidth and eliminate light and pressure shifts by:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Mode-locked laser (short interaction time, high peak intensity)
    \item Using Cesium (advantageous energy levels)
    \item High pressure buffer gas (pressure induced narrowing)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
