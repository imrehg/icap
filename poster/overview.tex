\begin{block}{The coherent population trapping clock}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The microwave frequency standard is cumbersome to link to the optical frequency range
  \item Coherent population trapping (CPT) or dark resonance is able to produce robust, narrow linewidth transitions, that can bridge the gap between microwave and optical freqencies
  \item In our scheme we further reduce the linewidth and eliminate light and pressure shifts of previous methods by:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Mode-locked laser (short interaction time, high peak intensity)
    \item Using cesium (advantageous energy levels)
    \item High pressure buffer gas (pressure induced narrowing)
    \end{itemize}
  \item Potentials
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Frequency reference over a wide optical bandwith
    \item Frequency reference over large distances due to high peak power
    \item Compact, robust, all-optical system
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
